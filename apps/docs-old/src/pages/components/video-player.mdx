### Import

```js
import {VideoPlayer, VideoPlayerProps} from '@comfortdelgro/react-compass'
```

or

```js
import VideoPlayer, {
  VideoPlayerProps,
} from '@comfortdelgro/react-compass/video-player'
```

We recommend the second method to import components for the benefits of [tree shaking](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Tree_shaking).
