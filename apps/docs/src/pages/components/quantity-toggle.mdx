### Import:

```js
import {QuantityToggle} from '@comfortdelgro/react-compass'
```

or

```js
import QuantityToggle from '@comfortdelgro/react-compass/quantity-toggle'
```

---

### Basic Quantity Toggle:

By default, NumberField is uncontrolled. However, when using the value prop, it becomes controlled. This allows you to store the current value in your own state, and use it elsewhere.

The onChange event is triggered whenever the number value updates. This happens when the user types a value and blurs the input, or when incrementing or decrementing the value. It does not happen as the user types because partial input may not be parseable to a valid number.

<section className={styles.componentShowcaseContainer}>
  <QuantityToggle
    placeholder='Price'
    onChange={(v) => console.log(v)}
    formatOptions={{
      style: 'currency',
      currency: 'USD',
    }}
  />
</section>

```js
<QuantityToggle
  placeholder='Price'
  onChange={(v) => console.log(v)}
  formatOptions={{
    style: 'currency',
    currency: 'USD',
  }}
/>
```

---

### Decimals:

The default formatting style for QT is decimal, but you can configure various aspects via the formatOptions prop. All options supported by Intl.NumberFormat are supported, including configuration of minimum and maximum fraction digits, sign display, grouping separators, etc. Currently only standard notation is supported, though scientific, engineering, and compact notation may be supported in the future.

The following example uses the signDisplay option to include the plus sign for positive numbers, for example to display an offset from some value. In addition, it always displays a minimum of 1 digit after the decimal point, and allows up to 2 fraction digits. If the user enters more than 2 fraction digits, the result will be rounded.

<section className={styles.componentShowcaseContainer}>
  <QuantityToggle
    label='Adjust exposure'
    defaultValue={0}
    formatOptions={{
      signDisplay: 'exceptZero',
      minimumFractionDigits: 1,
      maximumFractionDigits: 2,
    }}
  />
</section>

```js
<QuantityToggle
  label='Adjust exposure'
  defaultValue={0}
  formatOptions={{
    signDisplay: 'exceptZero',
    minimumFractionDigits: 1,
    maximumFractionDigits: 2,
  }}
/>
```

---

### Percentages:

The style: 'percent' option can be passed to the formatOptions prop to treat the value as a percentage. In this mode, the value is multiplied by 100 before it is displayed, i.e. 0.45 is displayed as 45%. The reverse is also true: when the user enters a value, the onChange event will be triggered with the entered value divided by 100. When the percent option is enabled, the default step automatically changes to 0.01 such that incrementing and decrementing occurs by 1%.

<section className={styles.componentShowcaseContainer}>
  <QuantityToggle
    label='Sales tax'
    defaultValue={0.05}
    formatOptions={{
      style: 'percent',
    }}
  />
</section>

```js
<QuantityToggle
  label='Sales tax'
  defaultValue={0.05}
  formatOptions={{
    style: 'percent',
  }}
/>
```

---

### Currency values:

The style: 'currency' option can be passed to the formatOptions prop to treat the value as a currency value. The currency option must also be passed to set the currency code (e.g. USD) to use. In addition, the currencyDisplay option can be used to choose whether to display the currency symbol, currency code, or currency name. Finally, the currencySign option can be set to accounting to use accounting notation for negative numbers, which uses parentheses rather than a minus sign in some locales.

If you need to allow the user to change the currency, you should include a separate dropdown next to the number field. The number field itself will not determine the currency from the user input.

<section className={styles.componentShowcaseContainer}>
  <QuantityToggle
    label='Transaction amount'
    defaultValue={45}
    formatOptions={{
      style: 'currency',
      currency: 'EUR',
      currencyDisplay: 'code',
      currencySign: 'accounting',
    }}
  />
</section>

```js
<QuantityToggle
  label='Transaction amount'
  defaultValue={45}
  formatOptions={{
    style: 'currency',
    currency: 'EUR',
    currencyDisplay: 'code',
    currencySign: 'accounting',
  }}
/>
```

---

### Units:

The style: 'unit' option can be passed to the formatOptions prop to format the value with a unit of measurement. The unit option must also be passed to set which unit to use (e.g. inch). In addition, the unitDisplay option can be used to choose whether to display the unit in long, short, or narrow format.

If you need to allow the user to change the unit, you should include a separate dropdown next to the number field. The number field itself will not determine the unit from the user input.

<section className={styles.componentShowcaseContainer}>
  <QuantityToggle
    label='Package width'
    defaultValue={4}
    formatOptions={{
      style: 'unit',
      unit: 'inch',
      unitDisplay: 'long',
    }}
  />
</section>

```js
<QuantityToggle
  label='Package width'
  defaultValue={4}
  formatOptions={{
    style: 'unit',
    unit: 'inch',
    unitDisplay: 'long',
  }}
/>
```

---

### Minimum and maximum values:

The minValue and maxValue props can be used to limit the entered value to a specific range. The value will be clamped when the user blurs the input field. In addition, the increment and decrement buttons will be disabled when the value is within one step value from the bounds (see below for info about steps). Ranges can be open ended by only providing either minValue or maxValue rather than both.

If a valid range is known ahead of time, it is a good idea to provide it to NumberField so it can optimize the experience. For example, when the minimum value is greater than or equal to zero, it is possible to use a numeric keyboard on iOS rather than a full text keyboard (necessary to enter a minus sign).

<section className={styles.componentShowcaseContainer}>
  <QuantityToggle label='Your math score' minValue={0} maxValue={10} />
</section>

```js
<QuantityToggle label='Your math score' minValue={0} maxValue={10} />
```

---

### Step values:

The step prop can be used to snap the value to certain increments. If there is a minValue defined, the steps are calculated starting from the minimum. For example, if minValue={2}, and step={3}, the valid step values would be 2, 5, 8, 11, etc. If no minValue is defined, the steps are calculated starting from zero and extending in both directions. In other words, such that the values are evenly divisible by the step. If no step is defined, any decimal value may be typed, but incrementing and decrementing snaps the value to an integer.

If the user types a value that is between two steps and blurs the input, the value will be snapped to the nearest step. When incrementing or decrementing, the value is snapped to the nearest step that is higher or lower, respectively. When incrementing or decrementing from an empty field, the value starts at the minValue or maxValue, respectively, if defined. Otherwise, the value starts from 0.

<section className={styles.componentShowcaseContainer}>
  <QuantityToggle label='Step' step={10} />
</section>

```js
<QuantityToggle label='Step' step={10} />
```

---

### Disabled and read only:

The isDisabled and isReadOnly props can be used prevent the user from editing the value of the number field. The difference is that isReadOnly still allows the input to be focused, while isDisabled prevents all user interaction.

<section className={styles.componentShowcaseContainer}>
  <QuantityToggle label='Disabled' isDisabled value={25} />
  <QuantityToggle label='Read only' isReadOnly value={32} />
</section>

```js
  <QuantityToggle label="Disabled" isDisabled value={25} />
  <QuantityToggle label="Read only" isReadOnly value={32} />
```

---

### Update Event:

The onUpdate is returned when the number field is updated. It's will returned full string of value includes comma separated, dot separated, currency sign, ...

<section className={styles.componentShowcaseContainer}>
  <QuantityToggle
    placeholder='Price'
    onUpdate={(v) => console.log(v)}
    formatOptions={{
      style: 'currency',
      currency: 'USD',
    }}
  />
</section>

```js
<QuantityToggle
  placeholder='Price'
  onUpdate={(v) => console.log(v)}
  formatOptions={{
    style: 'currency',
    currency: 'USD',
  }}
/>
```

---

### Enable scroll to increment and decrement:

Using props `disabledScroll` and set it to `false` to enable scroll.

<section className={styles.componentShowcaseContainer}>
  <QuantityToggle
    placeholder='Price'
    disabledScroll={false}
    formatOptions={{
      style: 'currency',
      currency: 'USD',
    }}
  />
</section>

```js
<QuantityToggle
  placeholder='Price'
  disabledScroll={false}
  formatOptions={{
    style: 'currency',
    currency: 'USD',
  }}
/>
```

---

### Error:

<section className={styles.componentShowcaseContainer}>
  <QuantityToggle
    label='Potato price'
    defaultValue={2}
    isErrored
    helperText='This is helper text'
    errorMessage='This is error message'
  />
</section>

```js
<QuantityToggle
  label='Potato price'
  defaultValue={2}
  isErrored
  helperText='This is helper text'
  errorMessage='This is error message'
