# Installation

<p class="description">Install React Compass, the world's most popular React UI framework.</p>

## Important Note: Using Poppins Font from Google Fonts

For the components in the `@comfortdelgro/react-compass` package to work correctly, it is essential to use the **Poppins font** from Google Fonts. This is because most components in React Compass are designed with the Poppins font.

### Steps to Include Poppins Font in Your Project:

1. **Add the Poppins Font Link**:
  
   Include the following link in the `<head>` section of your HTML file (usually `index.html` in a React project):

   ```html
   <link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Poppins:400,500,600,700&display=swap" rel="stylesheet">

2. **Testing the Font**:
   
   After adding the font, run your application to ensure that the font is applied correctly. Check different components to verify that they display as expected.
