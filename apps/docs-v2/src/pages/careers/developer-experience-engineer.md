## About the company

MUI started with Material UI, the most successful React implementation of Google's Material Design.
We have gained a large following, thanks to our focus on Material Design fidelity, our obsession with details, on offering a large number of components, our community engagement, and by carefully improving the DX.
Today, countless teams and organizations rely on our open-source libraries to build their design system.

A couple of years ago, we started to expand our suite of products.
We released [MUI X](https://mui.com/x/), a collection of advanced components; [MUI Design kits](https://mui.com/design-kits/), the MUI components available for Figma, Sketch, etc.; and also host [Templates](https://mui.com/templates/), a set of pre-built UI kits.
We've seen rapid growth with all of them (2-3x per year) and we have more to come.
We are building [a low-code platform](https://mui.com/toolpad/) for developers to significantly increase the speed and lower the barrier for creating simple CRUD/dashboard UIs with MUI's libraries.

We are a fully distributed team, spread across multiple time zones.
We work mainly asynchronously, relying mostly on written collaboration.
Every contributor has the freedom to define how they work â€” the rest of us won't know what you're doing day-to-day unless you tell us.
For additional details about the MUI team and culture, you can check our [careers](https://mui.com/careers/) and [about](https://mui.com/about/) pages and also our [public Handbook](https://mui-org.notion.site/Handbook-f086d47e10794d5e839aef9dc67f324b).

## Why we're hiring

Both our open-source community and our premium products are growing fast (x2 YoY).
We need talented people to keep that going!

Developer Experience matters, [a lot](https://future.com/the-case-for-developer-experience/).
We are looking for somebody to build the best developer experience ever created around a component library, earning the love of developers everywhere.
This is about focusing on the outcome: success, that developers can have a wonderful workflow with our product.

We are looking for someone that can contribute to the following outcomes:

- Amplify the need of the community so the product direction aims at what people need the most.
- Improve the overall developer experience, resulting in better NPS & CSAT scores.
- Create momentum in the React community and drive adoption of the library.

### Why this is interesting

You have a lot of feedback, more than we can process. It's an opportunity to challenge the state of the art in the React component dev tool space.

Our products empower React developers to build awesome applications faster â€“ we see millions of developers on MUI's docs every year, one million a month.

## About you

### Skills you should have

- **A track record of demonstrating an eye for product and solving real-world user problems.** If you have a knack for solving problems at the root cause, shipping beautiful user interfaces and intuitive APIs, we want you on our team.
- **Expertise in the modern JavaScript ecosystem**.
  MUI is built on the shoulders of giants, making use of technologies such as ES2021, TypeScript, Node.js, React, Next.js, webpack, and Babel.
- **Strong written and verbal communication skills**.
  As part of the team, you'll interface both directly and indirectly with community members and enterprise customers, and contribute to user documentation. Clear communication is fundamental in creating intuitive and compelling resources.
- **Ability to dive into complex problems**.
  You should be able to quickly assess, understand, and iterate upon aspects of our codebase.
- **Ready and willing to ask and answer questions**.
  If you're comfortable saying you're unsure, asking for help; but equally reaching out to assist others, you'll be an incredible addition to our team. We thrive because of continuous learning. First-time mistakes should be celebrated, not blamed.
- **Past work with front-end infrastructure**.
  Perhaps you've created your company's design system, written a Babel plugin, or written complex React components.
  It would be great if you could address this in your cover letter!

### What it would be nice if you had, but isn't required

- **You've contributed to a design system before**.
  You have worked on enterprise components in the past, maybe for internal use in your company.
  You have built complex and advanced features while making sure the accessibility was fully functional.
- **You've maintained an active repository before**.
  Maybe you've helped maintain a popular open-source repository, or perhaps you've worked on internal repositories that saw contributions from multiple teams.
  Previous experience with highly active repository workflows is a definite plus for this role.
- **You have contributed code to MUI before**. A history of contributing to MUI would be a definite plus.
