## About the company

MUI started with Material UI, the most successful React implementation of Google's Material Design.
We have gained a large following, thanks to our focus on Material Design fidelity, our obsession with details, on offering a large number of components, our community engagement, and by carefully improving the DX.
Today, countless teams and organizations rely on our open-source libraries to build their design system.

A couple of years ago, we started to expand our suite of products.
We released [MUI X](https://mui.com/x/), a collection of advanced components; [MUI Design kits](https://mui.com/design-kits/), the MUI components available for Figma, Sketch, etc.; and also host [Templates](https://mui.com/templates/), a set of pre-built UI kits.
We've seen rapid growth with all of them (2-3x per year) and we have more to come.
We are building [a low-code platform](https://mui.com/toolpad/) for developers to significantly increase the speed and lower the barrier for creating simple CRUD/dashboard UIs with MUI's libraries.

We are a fully distributed team, spread across multiple time zones.
We work mainly asynchronously, relying mostly on written collaboration.
Every contributor has the freedom to define how they work â€” the rest of us won't know what you're doing day-to-day unless you tell us.
For additional details about the MUI team and culture, you can check our [careers](https://mui.com/careers/) and [about](https://mui.com/about/) pages and also our [public Handbook](https://mui-org.notion.site/Handbook-f086d47e10794d5e839aef9dc67f324b).

## Why we're hiring

Both our open-source community and our premium products are growing fast (x2 YoY).
We need talented people to keep that going!

We are aiming to make high-end design accessible to the many, empowering developers that lack access to a designer as well as saving time for designers with a source they can trust.
[According to our last survey](https://mui.com/blog/2021-developer-survey-results/#what-are-your-most-important-criteria-for-choosing-a-ui-library), the quality of the design execution (UX & UI) is the most important criteria used by developers & designers to pick their next UI library.

### Why this is interesting

Our products empower React developers to build awesome applications faster â€“ we see millions of developers on MUI's docs every year, one million a month.

But while we are [the leading](https://tsh.io/state-of-frontend/#over-the-past-year-which-of-the-following-design-systems-was-your-favorite-go-to-solution) UI design system in the frontend space, the adoption of MUI is only at 25%. More importantly, the challenges of developers and designers to solve when creating UIs go way beyond the ones of design systems.
We envision a future where MUI becomes the default toolkit for web developers to create UIs.
It's why we started Base UI, Joy UI, and MUI Toolpad. Design is key to achieving this goal.

## About the role

### What you'll do on a day-to-day basis

Depending on the day, you'll:

- Work closely with our designers to prototype and implement new components, features, and screens.
- Design and build entire experiences for sites like mui.com or products like MUI Toolpad.
- Concept and prototype UX components and motion studies for components like the date picker.
- Extend our different design systems (Material UI, Joy UI).
- Create appealing new demos in the docs.

## About you

### Skills you should have

- 3+ years of relevant web front-end development experience at a tech-forward, product-driven company.
- Advanced knowledge of modern React, HTML, and CSS.
- Experience designing and building public facing-sites that work elegantly.

### What would be nice if you had, but isn't required

- A good understanding of the formal elements of design, not just limited to the web and including typography, layout, balance, and proportion.

## Benefits & Compensation

Competitive compensation depending on the profile and location.
We are ready to pay top market rates for a person that can clearly exceed the role's expectations.
