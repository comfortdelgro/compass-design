# Head of Operations

<p class="description">You will take ownership of designing, implementing, and overseeing most of the business operations to support MUI's growth.</p>

## Details of the Role

- **Location**: Remote (preference for UTC-6 to UTC+5).
- **Type of work**: Full-time (contractor or employee [depending on circumstances](https://mui-org.notion.site/Hiring-FAQ-64763b756ae44c37b47b081f98915501#494af1f358794028beb4b7697b5d3102)).
- We're a **remote** company, operating mostly asynchronously.

## About the company

MUI started with Material UI, the most successful React implementation of Google's Material Design.
We have gained a large following, thanks to our focus on Material Design fidelity, our obsession with details, on offering a large number of components, our community engagement, and by carefully improving the DX.
Today, countless teams and organizations rely on our open-source libraries to build their design system.

A couple of years ago, we started to expand our suite of products.
We released [MUI X](https://mui.com/x/), a collection of advanced components; [MUI Design kits](https://mui.com/design-kits/), the MUI components available for Figma, Sketch, etc.; and also host [Templates](https://mui.com/templates/), a set of pre-built UI kits.
We've seen rapid growth with all of them (2-3x per year) and we have more to come.
We are building [a low-code platform](https://mui.com/toolpad/) for developers to significantly increase the speed and lower the barrier for creating simple CRUD/dashboard UIs with MUI's libraries.

We are a fully distributed team, spread across multiple time zones.
We work mainly asynchronously, relying mostly on written collaboration.
Every contributor has the freedom to define how they work â€” the rest of us won't know what you're doing day-to-day unless you tell us.
For additional details about the MUI team and culture, you can check our [careers](https://mui.com/careers/) and [about](https://mui.com/about/) pages and also our [public Handbook](https://mui-org.notion.site/Handbook-f086d47e10794d5e839aef9dc67f324b).

## Why we're hiring

Both our open-source community and our premium products are growing fast (x2 YoY).
We need talented people to keep that going!

We have found market fit but we increasingly don't have the tools (in the broad sense) necessary to keep up with the requests from our users.
Up to recently, the founders of MUI were the only ones to work on business operations.
There is now a tiny team of two people working to support the operations needs.
But this isn't enough, the department is increasingly a bottleneck in growing the company.
We are looking for a Head of Operations to take ownership of designing, implementing, and overseeing most of the business operations to support MUI's growth.

### Why this is interesting

Our approach to business operations is centered around operational excellence.
It involves relying on automation and writing custom code where necessary.
We are even building a product dedicated to improving internal tools for companies: https://mui.com/toolpad/ which we increasingly rely on internally.
You will likely use it a lot to improve processes.

Our products empower React developers to build awesome applications faster â€“ we see millions of developers on MUI's docs every year, one million a month.
