## About the company

MUI started with Material UI, the most successful React implementation of Google's Material Design.
We have gained a large following, thanks to our focus on Material Design fidelity, our obsession with details, on offering a large number of components, our community engagement, and by carefully improving the DX.
Today, countless teams and organizations rely on our open-source libraries to build their design system.

A couple of years ago, we started to expand our suite of products.
We released [MUI X](https://mui.com/x/), a collection of advanced components; [MUI Design kits](https://mui.com/design-kits/), the MUI components available for Figma, Sketch, etc.; and also host [Templates](https://mui.com/templates/), a set of pre-built UI kits.
We've seen rapid growth with all of them (2-3x per year) and we have more to come.
We are building [a low-code platform](https://mui.com/toolpad/) for developers to significantly increase the speed and lower the barrier for creating simple CRUD/dashboard UIs with MUI's libraries.

We are a fully distributed team, spread across multiple time zones.
We work mainly asynchronously, relying mostly on written collaboration.
Every contributor has the freedom to define how they work â€” the rest of us won't know what you're doing day-to-day unless you tell us.
