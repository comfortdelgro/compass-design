# Switch

<p class="description">Switches toggle the state of a single setting on or off.</p>

## Introduction

Switches are very commonly used for adjusting settings on mobile. The option that the switch controls, as well as the state it's in, should be made clear from the corresponding inline label.

{{"demo": "SwitchUsage.js", "hideToolbar": true}}

{{"component": "modules/components/ComponentLinkHeader.js", "design": false}}

## Component

After [installation](/joy-ui/getting-started/installation/), you can start building with this component using the following basic elements:

```jsx
import Switch from '@mui/joy/Switch';

export default function MyApp() {
  return <Switch />;
}
```

### Controlled

To create a controlled switch, use the `checked` and `onChange` props.

{{"demo": "SwitchControlled.js"}}

### Label

Use the `Switch` component inside the `Typography`'s `endDecorator` prop for having labels.

{{"demo": "SwitchLabel.js"}}

### Decorators

To insert icon decorators, use the `startDecorator` and/or `endDecorator` props.

{{"demo": "SwitchDecorators.js"}}

### Track child

Target the track's children using the `slotProps` prop to display a text inside of it.

{{"demo": "ExampleTrackChild.js"}}

### Thumb child

Simmilarly to the above, target the thumb's children to display icons inside of it.

{{"demo": "ExampleThumbChild.js"}}

## CSS Variables

Play around with all the CSS variables available in the switch component to see how the design changes.

You can use those to customize the component on both the `sx` prop and the theme.

{{"demo": "SwitchVariables.js"}}

## Accessibility

Here are a few tips to make sure you have an accessible switch component:

- The `Switch` will render with the `checkbox` role as opposed to `switch`. This is mainly because the latter isn't widely supported yet. However, if you believe your audience will support it, make sure to test with assistive technology. Use the `componentProps` prop to change the role:

  ```jsx
  <Switch slotProps={{ input: { role: 'switch' } }}>
  ```

- Every form control component should have proper labels. This includes radio buttons, checkboxes, and switches. In most cases, this is done using the `<label>` element.
  - If a label can't be applied, make sure to add an attribute (e.g. `aria-label`, `aria-labelledby`, `title`) to the input slot inside the `componentProps` prop.
  ```jsx
  <Switch value="checkedA" slotProps={{ 'aria-label': 'Switch A' }} />
  ```

## Common examples

### Material Design

You can also find the Material Design switch design, out of the box, in [Material UI's documentation](/material-ui/react-switch/).

{{"demo": "ExampleMaterialSwitch.js"}}

### Fluent

Here's how you'd customize Joy UI's switch to make it look like [Microsoft's Fluent UI](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/fluentui#/controls/web/toggle):

- Unchecked state: `outlined` variant and `neutral` color.
- Checked state: `solid` variant and `primary` color.

{{"demo": "ExampleFluentSwitch.js"}}

### iOS

Note how we've used the `:active` pseudo-class to replicate the small thumb size increase, which happens when you press and holder the switch.

### Strapi

### Chakra UI
