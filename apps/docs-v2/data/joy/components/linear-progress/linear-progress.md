# Linear Progress

<p class="description">Linear Progress indicators, commonly known as loaders, express an unspecified wait time or display the length of a process.</p>

{{"component": "modules/components/ComponentLinkHeader.js", "design": false}}

## Introduction

Progress indicators inform users about the status of ongoing processes, such as loading an app, submitting a form, or saving updates.

The `LinearProgress` is indeterminate by default, indicating an unspecified wait time.
To actually have it represent how long an operation will take, use the [determinate](#determinate) mode.

The animations of the components rely on CSS as much as possible to work even before the JavaScript is loaded.

{{"demo": "LinearProgressUsage.js", "hideToolbar": true, "bg": "gradient"}}

## Component

After [installation](/joy-ui/getting-started/installation/), you can start building with this component using the following basic elements:

```jsx
import LinearProgress from '@mui/joy/LinearProgress';

export default function MyApp() {
  return <LinearProgress />;
}
```

### Variants

The linear progress component supports the four global variants: `solid`, `soft` (default), `outlined`, and `plain`.

### Colors

Every palette included in the theme is available via the `color` prop.
Play around combining different colors.

### Thickness

## CSS variables
