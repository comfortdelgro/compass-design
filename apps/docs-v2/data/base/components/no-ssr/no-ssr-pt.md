# No SSR

<p class="description">The NoSsr component defers the rendering of children components from the server to the client.</p>

## Introduction

`NoSsr` is a utility component that prevents its children from being rendered on the server.

This component can be useful in a variety of situations:

- To create an escape hatch for broken dependencies that don't support server-side rendering (SSR)
- To improve the time to first paint by only rendering above the fold
- To reduce the rendering time on the server
- To turn on service degradation when the server load is too heavy
- To improve the Time to Interactive (TTI) by only rendering what's important (using the `defer` prop)

## Component

### Usage

After [installation](/base-ui/getting-started/quickstart/#installation), you can start building with this component using the following basic elements:

```jsx
import NoSsr from '@mui/base/NoSsr';

export default function MyApp() {
  return <NoSsr>{/* element to be rendered on the client side */}</NoSsr>;
}
```

### Basics

At its core, the `NoSsr` component's purpose is to defer rendering from the server to the client, as shown in the following demo:

{{"demo": "SimpleNoSsr.js"}}

## Customization

### Delay client-side rendering

You can also use `NoSsr` to delay the rendering of specific components on the client sideâ€”for example, to let the rest of the application load before an especially complex or data-heavy component.

The following demo shows how to use the `defer` prop to prioritize rendering the rest of the app outside of what is nested within `NoSsr`:

:::warning
When using `NoSsr` in this way, React applies [two commits](https://react.dev/learn/render-and-commit) instead of one.
