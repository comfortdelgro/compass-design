# Unstyled modal

<p class="description">The ModalUnstyled component lets you create dialogs, popovers, lightboxes, and other elements that force the user to take action before continuing.</p>

## Introduction

`ModalUnstyled` is a utility component that renders its children in front of a backdrop. This lets you create an element that your users must interact with before continuing in the parent application.

### Features

- ü•û Manages modal stacking when more than one is needed
- ü™ü Creates a backdrop to disable interaction with the rest of the app
- üîê Disables page scrolling while open
- ‚å®Ô∏è Manages focus correctly between the modal and its parent app
- ‚ôøÔ∏è Adds the appropriate ARIA roles automatically

{{"component": "modules/components/ComponentLinkHeader.js", "design": false}}

:::info
The term "modal" is sometimes used interchangeably with "dialog," but this is incorrect. A dialog may be _modal_ or _nonmodal (modeless)_.

A modal [blocks interaction with the rest of the application](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modal_window), forcing the user to take action. As such, it should be used sparingly‚Äîonly when the app _requires_ user input before it can continue.

<!-- Uncomment the next line, once an unstyled dialog component is added in @mui/base -->
<!-- If you are creating a modal dialog, the \[`Dialog`\](/material-ui/dialog/) component is better suited for this specific use case. -->`ModalUnstyled` is a lower-level construct that is used in the following Material UI components:

- [Dialog](/material-ui/react-dialog/)
- [Drawer](/material-ui/react-drawer/)
- [Menu](/material-ui/react-menu/)
- [Popover](/material-ui/react-popover/)

## Component

### Usage

After [installation](/base-ui/getting-started/quickstart/#installation), you can start building with this component using the following basic elements:

```jsx
import ModalUnstyled from '@mui/base/ModalUnstyled';

export default function MyApp() {
  return <ModalUnstyled>{/* the modal's content */}</ModalUnstyled>;
}
```

### Basics

The following demo shows how to create and style a basic modal. Click **Open modal** to see how it behaves:

{{"demo": "ModalUnstyled.js", "defaultCodeOpen": false }}

## Customization

### Nested modal

:::warning
Though it is possible to create nested modals‚Äîfor example, a select modal within a dialog‚Äîstacking more than two at a time is discouraged.

This is because each successive modal blocks interaction with all elements behind it, making prior states inaccessible and overly complicated for the user to navigate through.
:::

The following demo shows how to nest one modal within another:

{{"demo": "NestedModal.js", "defaultCodeOpen": false}}

### Transitions

You can animate the open and close states of a modal using a transition component, as long as that component fulfills the following requirements:

- Is a direct child descendant of the modal
- Has an `in` prop‚Äîthis corresponds to the open/close state
- Calls the `onEnter` callback prop when the enter transition starts
- Calls the `onExited` callback prop when the exit transition is completed
:::info
The `onEnter` and `onExited` callbacks tell the modal to unmount the child content when closed and fully transitioned.
:::

`ModalUnstyled` has built-in support for [react-transition-group](https://github.com/reactjs/react-transition-group):

{{"demo": "TransitionsModal.js", "defaultCodeOpen": false}}

You can also use [react-spring](https://github.com/pmndrs/react-spring) with `ModalUnstyled`, but it will require additional custom configuration:

{{"demo": "SpringModal.js", "defaultCodeOpen": false}}

### Performance

The modal's content is unmounted when it is not open. This means that it will need to be re-mounted each time it is opened.

If you are rendering expensive component trees inside your modal, and you want to optimize for interaction responsiveness, you can change this default behavior by enabling the `keepMounted` prop.

You can also use the `keepMounted` prop if you want to make the content of the modal available to search engines (even when the modal is closed).

The following demo shows how to apply this prop to keep the modal mounted:

{{"demo": "KeepMountedModal.js", "defaultCodeOpen": false}}

:::info
You can use the `MuiModal-hidden` class to hide the modal when it is not open.
:::

As with any performance optimization, the `keepMounted` prop won't necessarily solve all of your problems. Explore other possible bottlenecks in performance where you could make more considerable improvements before implementing this prop.

### Server-side modal

React [doesn't support](https://github.com/facebook/react/issues/13097) the [`createPortal()`](https://react.dev/reference/react-dom/createPortal) API on the server.

In order to display a modal rendered on the server, you need to disable the portal feature with the `disablePortal` prop, as shown in the following demo:

{{"demo": "ServerModal.js", "defaultCodeOpen": false}}

## Limitations

### Focus trap

`ModalUnstyled` moves the focus back to the body of the component if the focus tries to escape it.

This is done for accessibility purposes, but it can potentially create issues for your users.

If the user needs to interact with another part of the page‚Äîfor example, to interact with a chatbot window while a modal is open in the parent app‚Äîyou can disable the default behavior with the `disableEnforceFocus` prop.

## Accessibility

See the [WAI-ARIA guide on the Dialog (Modal) pattern](https://www.w3.org/WAI/ARIA/apg/patterns/dialog-modal/) for complete details on accessibility best practices.

- All interactive elements must have an [accessible name](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Attributes/aria-labelledby). Use the `aria-labelledby="id..."` to give your `Modal` component an accessible name. You can also use `aria-describedby="id..."` to provide a description of the `Modal`:

  ```jsx
  <Modal aria-labelledby="modal-title" aria-describedby="modal-description">
    <h2 id="modal-title">My Title</h2>
    <p id="modal-description">My Description</p>
  </Modal>
  ```

- Follow the [WAI-ARIA authoring practices](https://www.w3.org/WAI/ARIA/apg/patterns/dialog-modal/examples/dialog/) to help you set the initial focus on the most relevant element based on the content of the modal.
:::warning
A modal window can sit on top of either the parent application, or another modal window. _All_ windows under the topmost modal are **inert**, meaning the user cannot interact with them. This can lead to [conflicting behaviors](#focus-trap).
