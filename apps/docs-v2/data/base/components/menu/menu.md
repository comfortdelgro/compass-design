# Menu

<p class="description">The Menu components provide your users with a list of options on temporary surfaces.</p>

{{"component": "modules/components/ComponentLinkHeader.js", "design": false}}

{{"component": "modules/components/ComponentPageTabs.js"}}

## Introduction

The Menu component gives users a list of items in a popup that they can navigate through with a mouse or keyboard.
It renders an unordered list (`<ul>`) by default.

Use the Menu Item to add items to the menu.
These are rendered as `<li>` elements.

{{"demo": "UnstyledMenuIntroduction.js", "defaultCodeOpen": false, "bg": "gradient"}}

## Components

### Usage

After [installation](/base-ui/getting-started/quickstart/#installation), you can start building with this component collection using the following basic elements:

```jsx
import Menu from '@mui/base/Menu';
import MenuItem from '@mui/base/MenuItem';

export default function MyApp() {
  return (
    <Menu>
      <MenuItem>{/* item one */}</MenuItem>
      <MenuItem>{/* item two */}</MenuItem>
    </Menu>
  );
}
```

### Basics

The Menu serves as a replacement for the native HTML `<ul>`, and the Menu Item corresponds to the `<li>` tag.

The following demo shows how to create and style a Menu component.
Click **Dashboard** to view the menu—notice that it uses the built-in [Popper](/base-ui/react-popper/) component to visually break out of its parent container:

{{"demo": "UnstyledMenuSimple.js"}}

### Anatomy

The Menu component is composed of a root slot that renders a Popper `<div>` by default.
It contains one interior listbox `<ul>` slot.
The Menu Item has a single root `<li>` slot.

```html
<div class="MuiMenu-root">
  <ul class="MuiMenu-listbox">
    <li class="MuiMenuItem-root">List item</li>
  </ul>
</div>
```

### Custom structure

Use the `slots` prop to override the root or any other interior slot:

```jsx
<Menu slots={{ root: 'nav', listbox: 'ol' }} />
```

:::info
The `slots` prop is available on all non-utility Base components.
See [Overriding component structure](/base-ui/guides/overriding-component-structure/) for full details.
:::

Use the `slotProps` prop to pass custom props to internal slots.
The following code snippet applies a CSS class called `my-listbox` to the listbox slot:

```jsx
<Menu slotProps={{ listbox: { className: 'my-listbox' } }} />
```

#### Usage with TypeScript

In TypeScript, you can specify the custom component type used in the `slots.root` as a generic parameter of the unstyled component. This way, you can safely provide the custom root's props directly on the component:

```tsx
<Menu<typeof CustomComponent> slots={{ root: CustomComponent }} customProp />
```

The same applies for props specific to custom primitive elements:

```tsx
<Menu<'button'> slots={{ root: 'button' }} onClick={() => {}} />
```

### CSS classes

Menu can set the following class:

- `Mui-expanded` - set when the menu is open; this class is set on both Root and Popper slots

Menu Item can set the following classes:

- `Mui-disabled` - set when the MenuItem has the `disabled` prop
- `Mui-focusVisible` - set when the MenuItem is highlighted via keyboard navigation.
  This is a polyfill for the native `:focus-visible` pseudoclass as it's not available in Safari.

## Hooks

```jsx
import useMenu from '@mui/base/useMenu';
import useMenuItem from '@mui/base/useMenuItem';
```

The `useMenu` and `useMenuItem` hooks let you apply the functionality of the Menu components to fully custom components.
They return props to be placed on the custom components, along with fields representing the components' internal states.

Hooks _do not_ support [slot props](#slot-props), but they do support [customization props](#customization).

:::info
Hooks give you the most room for customization, but require more work to implement.
With hooks, you can take full control over how your component is rendered, and define all the custom props and CSS classes you need.

You may not need to use hooks unless you find that you're limited by the customization options of their component counterparts—for instance, if your component requires significantly different [structure](#anatomy).
:::

The following demo shows how to build a menu using hooks:

{{"demo": "UseMenu.js"}}

Components and their corresponding hooks work interchangeably with one another—for example, you can create a Menu component that contains menu items built with the `useMenuItem` hook.

## Customization

### Wrapping MenuItems

Menu Item components don't have to be direct children of a Menu component.
You can wrap them in any component needed to achieve the desired appearance.

In addition to Menu Item components, the Menu component can also contain non-interactive children, such as helper text.

The following demo shows an example of a menu with items grouped under non-interactive headers, along with helper text that displays the **Current zoom level**:
