# React Templates

<p class="description">Browse our collection of free React templates to get started building your app with Material UI, including a React dashboard, React admin panel, and more.</p>

<!-- #default-branch-switch -->

Our curated collection of Material UI templates includes dashboards, sign-in and sign-up pages, a blog, a checkout flow, and more.

The templates can be combined with one of the [example projects](https://github.com/mui/material-ui/tree/master/examples) to form a complete starter.

Sections of each layout are clearly defined either by comments or use of separate files,
making it simple to extract parts of a page (such as a "hero unit", or footer, for example)
for reuse in other pages.
For multi-part examples, a table in the README at the linked source code location describes
the purpose of each file.
