## Your first component

The following code snippet demonstrates a basic Material UI app that features a `<Button>` component:

```jsx
import * as React from 'react';
import Button from '@mui/material/Button';

function App() {
  return <Button variant="contained">Hello World</Button>;
}
```

In the interactive demo below, try changing the code and see how it affects the output. (Hint: change `variant` to `"outlined"` and `color` to `"secondary"`. For more options, see the [`Button` component page](/material-ui/react-button/).)
