<p class="description">The Click-Away Listener component detects when a click event happens outside of its child element.</p>

:::warning
Please refer to the [Click-Away Listener](/base-ui/react-click-away-listener/) component page in the Base UI docs for demos and details on usage.

Click-Away Listener is a part of the standalone [Base UI](/base-ui/getting-started/) component library.
It is currently re-exported from `@mui/material` for your convenience, but it will be removed from this package in a future major version, after `@mui/base` gets a stable release.
