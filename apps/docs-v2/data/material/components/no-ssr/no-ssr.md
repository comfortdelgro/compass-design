<p class="description">The No-SSR component defers the rendering of children components from the server to the client.</p>

:::warning
Please refer to the [No-SSR](/base-ui/react-no-ssr/) component page in the Base UI docs for demos and details on usage.

No-SSR is a part of the standalone [Base UI](/base-ui/getting-started/) component library.
It is currently re-exported from `@mui/material` for your convenience, but it will be removed from this package in a future major version, after `@mui/base` gets a stable release.
