# CSS theme variables

<p class="description">An overview of adopting CSS theme variables in Material UI.</p>

[CSS variables](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-variables-1/) are a modern cross-browser feature that let you declare variables in CSS and reuse them in other properties.
You can implement them to improve Material UI's theming and customization experience.

## Introduction

CSS theme variable support is a new feature in Material UI added in [`v5.6.0`](https://github.com/mui/material-ui/releases/tag/v5.6.0) (but not enabled by default). It tells Material UI components to use the generated CSS theme variables instead of raw values. This provides significant improvements in developer experience related to theming and customization.
With these variables, you can inject a theme into your app's stylesheet _at build time_ to apply the user's selected settings before the whole app is rendered.

## Advantages

- It lets you prevent [dark-mode SSR flickering](https://github.com/mui/material-ui/issues/27651).
- You can create unlimited color schemes beyond `light` and `dark`.
- It offers a better debugging experience not only for developers but also designers on your team.
- The color scheme of your website is automatically synced between browser tabs.
- It simplifies integration with third-party tools because CSS theme variables are available globally.
- It reduces the need for a nested theme when you want to apply dark styles to a specific part of your application.

## Trade-offs

For server-side applications, there are some trade-offs to consider:

|                                                      | Compare to the default method | Reason                                                                                                       |
| :--------------------------------------------------- | :---------------------------- | :----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| HTML size                                            | Bigger                        | CSS variables are generated for both light and dark mode at build time.                                      |
| [First Contentful Paint (FCP)](https://web.dev/fcp/) | Larger                        | Since the HTML size is generally bigger, the time to download the HTML before showing the content is longer. |
| [Time to Interactive (TTI)](https://web.dev/tti/)    | Smaller (for dark mode)       | Stylesheets are not regenerated between light and dark mode, so it takes less time for JavaScript to run.    |

:::warning
The comparison described in the table above may not be applicable to large and complex applications since there are so many factors that can impact performance metrics.

## Mental model

Adopting CSS variables requires some shifts in your mental model of theming and customizing user-selected modes.

### Colors

**[Default approach](/material-ui/customization/dark-mode/)**: Light and dark colors are created separately.

```js
const lightTheme = createTheme();

const darkTheme = createTheme({
  palette: {
    mode: 'dark',
  },
});
```

**CSS theme variables**: Light and dark colors are consolidated into a theme.

```js
// `extendTheme` is a new API
const theme = extendTheme({
  colorSchemes: {
    light: { // palette for light mode
      palette: {...}
    },
    dark: { // palette for dark mode
      palette: {...}
    }
  }
})
```

### Styling

**Default approach**: Usually relies on JavaScript to switch the value between modes:

```js
createTheme({
  components: {
    MuiButton: {
      styleOverrides: {
        root: ({ theme }) => ({
          // use JavaScript conditional expression
          color: theme.palette.mode === 'dark' ? '#fff' : theme.palette.primary.main,
        }),
      },
    },
  },
});
```

**CSS theme variables**: Styling leans toward cascading and specificity by using the appropriate selector which lets you prevent [dark-mode SSR flickering](https://github.com/mui/material-ui/issues/27651):

```js
extendTheme({
  components: {
    MuiButton: {
      styleOverrides: {
        root: ({ theme }) => ({
          color: theme.vars.palette.primary.main,
          // When the mode switches to dark, the attribute selector is attached to
          // the <html> tag by default.
          '[data-mui-color-scheme="dark"] &': {
            color: '#fff',
          },
        }),
      },
    },
  },
});
```
