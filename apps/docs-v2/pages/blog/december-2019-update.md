Here are the most significant improvements in December:

- 🚨 We have introduced a new [Alert](https://v4.mui.com/components/alert/) component in the lab, thanks to **[@dimitropoulos](https://github.com/dimitropoulos)** ([#18702](https://github.com/mui/material-ui/pull/18702)). The component also supports composition with a [Snackbar](https://v4.mui.com/components/snackbars/#customized-snackbars).

- 🌎 We have almost doubled the number of supported [locales](https://v4.mui.com/guides/localization/#supported-locales) from 13 to 22, thanks to our awesome contributors. Help us double this number next month 🚀!

But this summary is just scratching the surface. We have accepted 168 commits from 73 different contributors. We have changed 1,059 files with 13,468 additions and 8,584 deletions.

## Our roadmap intent for January

_(We'll do our best, no guarantee!)_
