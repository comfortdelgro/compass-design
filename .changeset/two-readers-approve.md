Add more components such as `table`, `pagination`, `card` and `checkbox`. `@comfortdelgro/compass-icons` package is introduced with `Icon` component (aliased to `FontAwesomeIcon`) now directly exported from the `react-compass` package. We now support both CommonJS and ESM. The icons package also support both formats for use with [Iconify](https://iconify.design) and as pure [React](https://reactjs.org) components.
